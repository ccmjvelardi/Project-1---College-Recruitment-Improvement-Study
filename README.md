# Project-1---College-Recruitment-Improvement-Study

Using Python to perform an exploratory data analysis of the CCM Computing Courses Entry Surveys.  Provide insights that can help the Information Technologies department increase enrollment in computing classes.


This project begins by assessing the right questions for data analysis from uncleaned csv files of CCM Computer Science Surveys. Then the files are taken and cleaned up to get some useful data. Then once there's clean data we can use, the data is then plotted.
